Original dataset I used can be downloaded at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html

It's not included in this repo because it's 3gb compressed.

Most notebooks included in this repo, except final_model, won't run because they require larger datasets
which you can reproduce by downloading the original and taking smaller samples with the corresponding 
random_state.
